}
\arguments{
\item{m}{The number of subjects measured during each cluster-period.}

\item{J.arm}{The number of clusters in each arm.}

\item{delta}{The difference between the intervention and control means under the alternative minus the difference under the null hypothesis.}

\item{sd}{The total standard deviation of the outcome variable; defaults to 1.}

\item{icc}{The within-cluster, within-period intraclass correlation coefficient; defaults to 0.}

\item{iccb}{The within-cluster, between-period intraclass correlation coefficient. Either iccb and xi, OR cac and sac must be specified.}

\item{xi}{The  within-cluster, within-subject correlation (correlation between two measurements within the same subject). Either iccb and xi, OR cac and sac must be specified.}

\item{cac}{The cluster autocorrelation. Either iccb and xi, OR cac and sac must be specified.}

\item{sac}{The subject autocorrelation. Either iccb and xi, OR cac and sac must be specified.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level or type 1 error rate; defaults to 0.05.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{sides}{Either 1 or 2 (default) to specify a one- or two- sided hypothesis test.}

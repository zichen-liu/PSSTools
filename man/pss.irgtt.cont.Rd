\item{n}{The number of total participants in the control group.}

\item{delta}{The difference between the intervention and control means under the alternative minus the difference under the null hypothesis.}

\item{sd}{The total standard deviation of the outcome variable in the control group; defaults to 1.}

\item{icc}{The intraclass correlation coefficient in the treatment group; defaults to 0.}

\item{Theta}{The ratio of the total variance between intervention and control groups; defaults to 1.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level or type 1 error rate; defaults to 0.05.}

\item{power}{The specified level of power.}

\item{sides}{Either 1 or 2 (default) to specify a one- or two- sided hypothesis test.}
}

\title{Sample Size Calculation for McNemar's Test for paired proportions}
\usage{
mcnemar_ss(
  p1 = NULL,
  p2 = NULL,
  rho = NULL,
  p01 = NULL,
  p10 = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  power = 0.8,
  one_or_twosides = "two"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{Marginal probability of success for outcome 1. Either NULL or supplied alongside p2 and rho.}

\item{p2}{Marginal probability of success for outcome 2. Either NULL or supplied alongside p1 and rho.}

\item{rho}{Correlation between proportions. Either NULL or supplied alongside p1 and p2.}

\item{p01}{First discordant cell probability. Either NULL or supplied alongside p10.}

\item{p10}{Second discordant cell probability. Either NULL or supplied alongside p01.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Default is 0.05}

\item{power}{Required power. Default is 0.8.}

\item{one_or_twosides}{Whether the hypothesis test of interest is one or two-sided. Default is "two".}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with total number of observations needed (N_obs) and number of pairs needed (N_pairs).
}
\description{
Calculates the number of pairs needed to achieve specified level of power from marginal probabilities
and the correlation between probabilities (p1, p2, rho) OR from discordant cell probabilities (p01 and p10).
}
\examples{
# Calculate sample size supplying marginal probabilities of 0.8 and 0.9
# at 90\% power without any correlation between probabilities.
mcnemar_ss(p1 = 0.8, p2 = 0.9, rho = 0, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.9)
# Calculate sample size supplying cell probabilities at 90\% power
mcnemar_ss(p10 = 0.18, p01 = 0.08, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.9)
